      <h4>Physical Issues</h4>
      <div class="card">
        <h5 class="card-header bg-secondary text-light">Marks and Blemishes</h5>
        <div class="card-body">eBells are 3D printed and some cosmetic scars, blobs and lines occur as a result of the printing process. A
            string of plastic may also come away and hang loose.</div>
        <div class="card-footer bg-info text-light">
          <h5>Resolution</h5>
          <p>If a small amount of stringing occurs, cut off the string of plastic and seal the end with a drop of super
            glue. If a significant amount of stringing occurs, contact us for advice.</p>

            <p>If you do manage to damage an eBell, contact us for advice. We will do our best to help if it can be

        <div class="card">
          <h5 class="card-header bg-secondary text-light">Cable Damage</h5>
          <div class="card-body">Previous experience with motion controllers and our prototypes has shown that the cables may fracture if
              repeatedly bent in the same place. Cables can also be damaged by tripping over them,
              holding the eBells by their cable, or dropping them. The lifetime of a cable can be extended by always
              ensuring the cable is free to hang from the bell and not held tightly against one’s body.</div>
          <div class="card-footer bg-info text-light">
            <h5>Resolution</h5>
            <p>eBells are designed to enable the easy replacement of cables, which can be purchased online. These need
              to have a USB connector at one end and a USB-C connector at the other. For longevity,
              ensure that you buy cables that can withstand a very high number of bends, especially if you are a very
              frequent user. To replace, undo the two M3 bolts in the handles (if present) using a small Allen (hex) key, and
              feed the new cable through the exposed slot and push the USB-C end firmly into the bell's crown. Allow
              a little slack on the cable before retightening the bolts. Some versions of eBells have a rubber sleeve where the cable
            goes through the handle. In this case, snip through the outer heatshrink covering of the rubber sleeve (but not the rubber itself) to release
          the sleeve from the cable. The sleeve has a slit which will allow you to fit it to the same position on the new cable. The slit
          can be resealed with a thin wrap of insulating tape.</p>

        <h4>Connectivity Issues</h4>
        <div class="card">
          <h5 class="card-header bg-secondary text-light">No connection</h5>
          <div class="card-body">This is a common issue, and there are a number of causes. Please read the resolution carefully to determine the root cause.</div>
          <div class="card-footer bg-info text-light">
            <h5>Resolution</h5>
            <ul>
              <li><b>The eBell is not properly connected to your computer</b> - check that the bell is securely
                connected into a USB port and it is powered.</li>
              <li><b>Your operating system is not recognising the eBells</b> - a quick way to confirm whether your
                computer is recognising the eBell is to go to <a
                  href="https://gamepad-tester.com/">gamepad-tester.com</a> in your browser.
                If your computer is recognising the eBells, each eBell will show up as an entry as shown below.</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="row">
              <div class="col-2"></div>
              <div class="col-8">
                <img src="images/gamepad-tester.png" class="rounded float-left" width="100%" alt="gamepad tester">
                <p class="text-center"><i>gamepad tester with two eBells connected</i></p>
              </div>
            </div>
            <p>If your computer is not recognising the eBells, you will need to consult USB troubleshooting for your
              computer.</p>
            <p>You can also use this utility to confirm when other issues have been resolved, including whether your
              buttons (B1 and B2) work when you press them, and that the Axis 0 to 5 values change when you swing your
              bell.</p>
            <ul>
              <li><b>The cable has come unseated inside the eBell</b> - it is common issue that the cable has been
                yanked or has come unseated in the crown of the eBell. Although eBells are tested before
                despatch, the cable could become also unseated in transit. You can sometimes see a red LED if you look
                down the inside of the bell. While that means that the electronics have power, it is still
                possible that it does not have full connectivity. To resolve, use your fingers to push the cable firmly
                back into the bell from both sides of the handle. You can also carefully use a small pair of pliers.
              </li>
              <li><b>The cable is damaged</b> - the cable may have fractured internally due to wear and tear, or it may
                have a faulty connector. See Cable Damage under Physical Issues above.</li>
              <li><b>Incorrect simulator device selection</b> - If the eBells are showing up in Gamepad Tester as shown
                above, check that Handbell Stadium or Handbell Manager has the correct device selected for each eBell.
                See their documentation for more details.</li>

            <h5 class="card-header bg-secondary text-light">eBells do not ring</h5>
            <div class="card-body">If your eBells are connected as confirmed by the steps in the previous section, but do not ring, try the following resolutions.</div>
            <div class="card-footer bg-info text-light">
              <h5>Resolution</h5>
              <ul>
                <li>The appropriate simulator is not running. Check that the bells ring when the simulator is used with
                  the keyboard, or in the case of Handbell Stadium, in autopilot mode.</li>
                <li>For RingingRoom, its browser window must be kept in focus.</li>
                <li>More than one copy of the simulator is running. Close all but one instance.</li>
                <li>Check that you are running the latest version of your simulator and Handbell Manager or Handbell
                  Stadium.</li>
                  <li>Some users of versions of Handbell Manager prior to v2.2 have experienced bells not striking.
                    This was due to their computer's timer (Environment.TickCount) returning negative values. This
                    timer can be reset by doing a full shut down (sleep or hibernate is not sufficient), removing the power,
                    and powering the computer back on, however this problem is resolved in Handbell Manager v2.2.</li>
                <li>Handbell Manager is not running (required to connect to all simulators other than Handbell Stadium).
                </li>
                <li>The wrong simulator is chosen in Handbell Manager. Reselect using Run – Choose Simulator.</li>
                <li>The backstroke and handstroke strike positions are set too high or too low.</li>
                <li>The wrong Handbell swing axis is being used. See <a href="guidance.html">Guidance</a>.</li>
                <li>The device that the eBells are connected to is not selected in Handbell Manager or Handbell Stadium.

                <li>There is a small possibility that the accelerometer and gyro in your eBells might need
                  recalibrating. Using <a href="https://gamepad-tester.com/">gamepad-tester.com</a> in your browser,
                  check that Axis 1 and 2 are 0.0 and Axis 3 is -0.5 (rounded values) when the buttons are uppermost and the handle is held exactly horizontal.
