      <p>Read the troubleshooting sections below to see if there is anything that can help to resolve your problem. If not send an email to <a href="mailto:ebells@changeringing.co.uk?subject=eBells%20Support"
        target="_blank">ebells@changeringing.co.uk</a> explaining your problem as clearly as you can, including the versions of software being used where relevant.</p>
      <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
      <h4>Physical Issues</h4>
      <div class="card">
        <h5 class="card-header bg-secondary text-light">Marks and Blemishes</h5>
      <div class="card-body"><p>eBells are 3D printed and some cosmetic scars, blobs and lines occur as a result of the printing process. A string of plastic may also come away and hang loose.</p>
      </div>
        <div class="card-footer bg-secondary text-light">
          <h5>Resolution</h5>
        <p>If a small amount of stringing occurs, cut off the string of plastic and seal the end with a drop of super glue. If a significant amount of stringing occurs, contact us for advice.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h5 class="card-header bg-secondary text-light">Damaged Bell</h5>
      <div class="card-body"><p>eBells are fairly robust, but could be broken if dropped or hit against a hard surface.</p>
      </div>
        <div class="card-footer bg-secondary text-light">
          <h5>Resolution</h5>
        <p>If you do manage to damage an eBell, contact us for advice. We will do our best to help if it can be repaired for less than the cost of a new bell.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h5 class="card-header bg-secondary text-light">Cable Damage</h5>
      <div class="card-body"><p>Previous experience with motion controllers and our prototypes has shown that the cables may fracture if repeatedly bent in the same place. Cables can also be damaged by tripping over them, 
        holding the eBells by their cable, or dropping them. The lifetime of a cable can be extended by always ensuring the cable is free to hang from the bell and not held tightly against one’s body.</p>
      </div>
        <div class="card-footer bg-secondary text-light">
          <h5>Resolution</h5>
        <p>eBells are designed to enable the easy replacement of cables, which can be purchased online. These need to have a USB connector at one end and a USB-C connector at the other. For longevity,
          ensure that you buy cables that can withstand a very high number of bends, especially if you are a very frequent user. To replace, undo the two bolts in the handles (if present) using an M3 Allen (hex) key, and feed the new cable through the exposed slot and push the USB-C end firmly into the bell's crown. Allow
          a little slack on the cable before retightening the bolts.</p>

    <h4>Connectivity Issues</h4>
    <div class="card">
      <h5 class="card-header bg-secondary text-light">No connection</h5>
    <div class="card-body"><p>This is a common issue, and there are a number of causes. Please read the resolution carefully to determine the root cause.</p>
    </div>
      <div class="card-footer bg-secondary text-light">
        <h5>Resolution</h5>
      <ul>
        <li><b>The eBell is not properly connected to your computer</b> - check that the bell is securely connected into a USB port and it is powered.</li>
        <li><b>Your operating system is not recognising the eBells</b> - a quick way to confirm whether your computer is recognising the eBell is to go to <a href="https://gamepad-tester.com/">gamepad-tester.com</a> in your browser. 
          If your computer is recognising the eBells, each eBell will show up as an entry as shown below.</li>
      </ul>
          <div class="row">
          <div class="col-2"></div>
            <div class="col-8">
            <img src="images/gamepad-tester.png" class="rounded float-left" width="100%"
                alt="gamepad tester">
            <p class="text-center"><i>gamepad tester with two eBells connected</i></p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>If your computer is not recognising the eBells, you will need to consult USB troubleshooting for your computer.</p>
        <p>You can also use this utility to confirm when other issues have been resolved, including whether your buttons (B1 and B2) work when you press them, and that the Axis 0 to 5 values change when you swing your bell.</p>
        <ul>
      <li><b>The cable has come unseated inside the eBell</b> - it is common issue that the cable has been yanked or has come unseated in the crown of the eBell. Although eBells are tested before 
        despatch, the cable could become also unseated in transit. You can sometimes see a red LED if you look down the inside of the bell. While that means that the electronics have power, it is still
      possible that it does not have full connectivity. To resolve, use your fingers to push the cable firmly back into the bell from both sides of the handle. You can also carefully use a small pair of pliers.</li>
      <li><b>The cable is damaged</b> - the cable may have fractured internally due to wear and tear, or it may have a faulty connector. See Cable Damage under Physical Issues above.</li>
      <li><b>Incorrect simulator device selection</b> - If the eBells are showing up in Gamepad Tester as shown above, check that Handbell Stadium or Handbell Manager has the correct device selected for each eBell. See their documentation for more details.</li>
